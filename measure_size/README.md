# [Measuring size of objects in an image with OpenCV](https://pyimagesearch.com/2016/03/28/measuring-size-of-objects-in-an-image-with-opencv)

## Usage

I recommend you to use *small* image as input because *large* image could have
a lot of contours.

```shell
python object_size.py -w <width> -i <path_to_image_file>
```
